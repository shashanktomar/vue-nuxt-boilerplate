# Commit Message Format

We adhere to [`convential commit messages`](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
for easy [`changelog`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) creation.

## Making a commit

Run `yarn commit` to intialize commit process. We use
[`commitzen`](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) for simplifiying
the commit process. The commits are linted using [`commitlint`](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint) command.
