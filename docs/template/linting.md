# Linting

We lint everything, including: `javascript`, `vue`, `css`, and `scss`.
We love linting to be as strict as possible.

Everything works for raw files and single file components out of the box.
Everything is already configured, so you don't have to.

Use `yarn lint` to run everything we have.

## Javascript

[![JavaScript Style Guide][svg]](https://github.com/standard/standard)

We use `eslint` to lint `javascript`. 
We use `prettier` for code style. 
It is just like `standard` config, but stricter.
But, we have some additional checks that make our style even more stricter.

To run `js` linting execute: `yarn lint:js`.

### Configuring eslint

All configuration can be found inside `.eslintrc.js`.
We also have some specific configuration that is applied for tests only.
It is located inside `tests/.eslintrc.js` file.

It extends the default configuration with the new rules that are applied for
test frameworks that we use.

## flow

`flow` is an optional strict typing.
We use `prettier/flowtype`
to run these checks during linting stage.

You can enable `flow` on a per-file basis. So, it very easy to start.
When any `js` or `vue` file starts with `// @flow` comment 
it means that `flow` is enabled for this file. 
Otherwise, the file is ignored by `flow` checker.

You have full control: what files should be checked 
and what files should not be checked.
We recommend checking all files by default. 
And only exclude ones you have to exclude due to some errors or legacy.

There are two ways to handle `type` imports:

1. Explicitly importing each type when you need it

2. Implicitly including all your types by preloading them 
   from [`[libs]`](https://flow.org/en/docs/config/libs/) 
   section in `.flowconfig`

### vue-flow-typed

We use 3rd party typings for `vue`-related libraries: [`vue-flow-typed`](https://github.com/sobolevn/vue-flow-typed).
You can install and use each package individually depending on what 
packages are you using the most. And what types you need.

## jsdoc

We lint [`jsdoc`](http://usejsdoc.org/) annotation. 
The rule is simple: if you write `jsdoc` you should write a correct one.
You may not write them at all (however, that's not good).

We use [`eslint-plugin-jsdoc`](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc) 
to lint them.

## Vue

We also lint `.vue` files with the help of [`eslint-plugin-vue`](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue).

These checks are executed together with `javascript` linting.

## Styles

We use awesome [`stylelint`](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) 
to validate our `css` and `scss` files.
We also use strict config here. 
We stick to [`stylelint-config-strict-scss`](https://github.com/wemake-services/stylelint-config-strict-scss).

`stylelint` is not related with `eslint` at all. It is a standalone tool.
Other plugins for languages like `stylus`, `sass`, 
and `post-css` can also be installed if you need them.

To run `css` linting execute: `yarn lint:css`.

### Configuring stylelint

All configuration is done [inside `stylelint.config.js`](configuration.md#stylelint). 
It stores presets, rules, and plugins.

## Markdown

We lint markdown files with [`remark-lint`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint).
This tool allows us to write consistent documentation and `README` files.

To run `md` linting execute: `yarn lint:md`.

### Configuring remark

We use `docs/.remarkrc.js` to configure `remark`.
Read more about [configuration](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified-engine/blob/master/doc/configure.md). 

We also use [`.remarkignore`][remarkignore] file to ignore 
programmatically generated files.

## Afterwords

Linting can be easily changed to any other styles you like (or forced to use).
