# QA

We are using [`TestCafe`](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe) 
for Quality Assurance.

`TestCafe` allows to run QA tests without any other dependencies.

## Running

We don't use `testcafe` locally.
We encapsulate all QA-related stuff into one `docker` image.
Inside this container we have `chromium` and `firefox` installed.

This browsers are chosen as default ones. But you might need other ones.

To run this container:

```bash
BASE_TEST_URL="http://your-url" sh docker/testcafe/qa.sh
```

Read the source code and docs inside 
`docker/testcafe/qa.sh` for more information, 
usage examples, and parameters specifications.

## Browser support

`TestCafe` supports all top browsers including `ie11`, `chrome`, and `firefox`.
See [official docs][browser-support-docs] on this topic.

If you need more browsers you can enable 
[`browserstack`][browserstack] or [`saucelabs`][saucelabs].

## Custom selectors

Since we use `css-modules` it is impossible to query elements by `css` class 
names. Why?

This is required by design. When working with components you should not rely
on `css` or markup queries. 
Markup is the only thing available in traditional web. 
But we have a better thing to look for: components.

Components' names change less than `css` or markup.
And components are higher order representation of your logic.

That's why you should use components' names for querying.

We use [`testcafe-vue-selectors`](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-vue-selectors) 
and [`testcafe-nuxt-selectors`](https://github.com/kartojal/testcafe-nuxt-selectors)
by default.

That's how it works:

```js
import NuxtSelector from 'testcafe-nuxt-selectors'

// To select all comments inside current layout:
const comments = NuxtSelector('Nuxt Comment')
```

See `./docker/testcafe/fixtures` for more examples.

## Circle CI

## Running tests against real applications

We also encourage to run QA tests against real production websites and apps.

Why?
Because you will literally tests how your application behaves in a real world.
Covering all possible pitfalls and situations.

How to run QA against our test example?

```bash
# Mind the trailing slash, we don't need it!
BASE_TEST_URL='https://wemake-vue-demo.now.sh' sh docker/testcafe/qa.sh
```

At least, you should have a full production copy to run tests against it.
